Hook in html and tweet like so ..

<p class="tweet"></p>

Add the following jquery ..

$(document).ready(function() {
  $.fn.twitflop.defaults['user'] = 'mrjase';
  
  $('.tweet').tweetog({output: '[TW_USER] tweeted <strong>[TW_TEXT]</strong>'});
});

And the tweet will appear by magic ..

By default the first tweet that isn't an @reply will be shown.

The next stuff I'm going to add is to only pick up certain tweets, ie #hashtags or whatever.

The output is determined by a string you pass to the twitflop function, and has replacement values so far..

[TW_TEXT] - The tweet text
[TW_USER] - Name of tweeter, eg. Jason Cale
[TW_SCREEN_NAME] - the twitter username eg. mrjase
[TW_SOURCE] - where the tweet came from .. ie tweetie
[TW_CREATED_AT] - date (currently as timestamp, but will add relative time option)
[TW_REPLY_TO] - User replying to ..
[TW_REPLY_STATUS] - Status ID of the tweet replying to .. for linking etc ..

Early days but hopefully will be useful ..
